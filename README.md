# PortfolioWork

Here are some projects that I've worked on personally that are a part of my portfolio!

I really liked this design as it was beautiful, bright, and colourful, and is bright and appealing. It's something I want to really hammer on in future designs, but will have to keep in mind folk who have trouble discerning certain colours. In future, I'll find if there's a way to make sure that such colour schemes are reasonable and still adventurous!
